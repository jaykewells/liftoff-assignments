# Project Outline

###Project Name: One for Onesie

###Overview

I am building a website that helps facilitate trading and selling onesies and other small clothing items between parents. This is the smaller version of a larger idea that includes larger items and sets of items that operates off the same context.

One of the larger problems as a parent, especially when initially gearing up for baby, is that you can't predict the exact size of the baby or the baby's growth. I.E. my son was born at 10lbs 6oz, and didn't fit in newborn clothes after day 3. This left us with a significant amount of clothing that just wasn't useable and no longer having its tags because we were getting it ready to be used. 

One for Onesie solves this by allowing people to list onesies with a picture, description and tags that help communicate the size, style and all important theme of the onesies to other parents, and for other parents to request that onesie to be sent to them in exchange for a credit that allows users to request other onesies. 

The primary advantage of this system is to supersede things like Facebook Marketplace, Buy/Sell/Trade lists and Craig's List by making searching significantly easier to accomplish. 

###Features

Listing a Onesie: Users can add a onesie with a required picture. 
Search by Tag: Users can search by theme, color, size or style
Request a Onesie: Users are able to request a onesie from another user and confirm that they have received that onesie. 
Review a Onesie: Users take control of the listing process by verifying that new onesies meet community guidelines and looks good. Users can leave 
Persistent Users: Users can see their listed onesies, their traded onesies and their in progress onesies along with leaving user reviews on their shipping and condition.

###What I'll Have to Learn

How to store pictures in a database. Is a service like Amazon S3 appropriate or can we do it locally for display purposes?
How does the database track trades and transactions? 
How can we flag users to enable different user levels? 
How do we keep a user persistent in each view beyond the first?
